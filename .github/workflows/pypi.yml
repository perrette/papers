# Publishes to PyPI on tag push (e.g. v2.16.1).
# If this job fails with "400 Bad Request", the package may still be on PyPI: that usually
# means the workflow ran twice (e.g. tag pushed twice or job re-run) and the second upload
# failed because the version already exists. Use verbose: true output to see the real error.
